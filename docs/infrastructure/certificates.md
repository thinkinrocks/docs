# Certificates

Since we maintain our own network we sign our own certificates. The certification `TR-CA001` authority is ran on [Microslop](./servers/TR-001.md).

The certificates are served for all local websites at `*.thinkin-rocks.local` and are available at [files.thinkin-rocks.local](https://files.thinkin-rocks.local).
