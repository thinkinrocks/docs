# Kanboard

Kanboard is running at [kanboard.thinkin-rocks.local](https://kanboard.thinkin-rocks.local) is our Kanban board for storing and managing tasks. 

Tasks can be colored to indicate things. By default they are Yellow, but other colorings are possible and not regulated:
- Red for high priority.
- Blue for regular tasks, like monthly and daily maintenance.
- Grey for raw ideas.

The list of tasks is to be flushed every Wednesday or on another scheduled meeting day: old tasks in the "Done" are closed (**NOT** removed).

_Managed by Artur._
