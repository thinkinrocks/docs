# Admin / Sudo

The administrator permissions on Windows machines are restricted to only approved persons. If you need admin permissions for something just ask _Alex_ or _Artur_.

The sudo permissions on the Linux machines are also managed through active directory. There exists a user group `sudoku` that grants access to any user-facing Linux machines.
