# Labelling

We have our own labelling system for things, it is designed to be easy and identifiable.

Consider a USB Flash Drive, it's name could be `USBFLASH-014-AF3`.

- `USBFLASH` is a human-readable segment.
- `014` is a serial number, it increments by one every time a new item is added.
- `AV3` is 3 random alphanumeric characters. 

## Using It

Imagine that you're trying to label a set of 4 displays.

1. Recall that the prefix for displays is `DISPLAY-`.
2. Remember the highest display number you saw. If you don't recall any just use a random one. I remember that my own display is `004-`.
3. Make up 3 random alphanumeric characters. I'll go with `FTW`.
4. Finally, we get the code `DISPLAY-004-FTW`. Nice.

Now we just repeat the procedure for all the displays, simple!
